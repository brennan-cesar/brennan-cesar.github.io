        <h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Brennan. <i>Welcome!</i></h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        Thanks for checking out my page. I'm Brennan Cesar, a third-year at Northeastern University currently studying Electrical Engineering with a minor in Robotics.
    </p>
    <h3>What do I do?</h3>
    <p>Stuff! Check it all out on my projects page <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>But really, I keep myself busy. I recently completed an Electrical Engineering Co-op at Boston Engineering, where I designed PCBs, assembled complex robots, and completed lots of research. As much as I would love to talk about it, all the cool stuff is under CUI. womp womp.</p>
    <p>I was the Head of Electronics for Northeastern Electric Racing, where I focused on designing and assembling low-voltage circuit boards. Check out the website <a href="https://electricracing.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>. Luckily I can talk all about the design work, which you can check out in the projects page linked above.</p>
    <p>I also participated in AerospaceNU's Intro Propulsion team, designing and manufacturing hybrid propulsion engines. I gained a lot of respect for rocket scientists, and it was great to have a successful launch.</p>
    <p>Before all that, I was the captain of our FRC robotics team in high school, taking us to the world championship for the first time. Go 2713! I've had my fair share of personal projects throughout the years, some big and some small, but all interesting and helped me learn nonetheless.</p>
